# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Firstly, I conducted EDA to identify patterns and trends of predicting variables and the target variable.
Secondly, preprocessed the data by cleaning missing values, encoding categorical data, scaling the data.
Thirdly, I built a XGBoost baseline model and use Grid Search to find the optimal parameters, the result shows 84% accuracy on whether customers will stay, churn or join.
Finally, applied metrics e.g. confusion matrix, precision, recall and f1-score to evaluate the model.
